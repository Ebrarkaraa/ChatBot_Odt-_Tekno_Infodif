Creating a chatbot with pytorch

## ChatBot Nedir? ##

**Chatbot nedir?** 

Chatbots are chatbots that users communicate with as if they are writing to a human through digital messaging, and that they use for various purposes such as obtaining information and taking action on a subject. Using a chatbot, it is possible to order pizza, buy movie tickets, check-in for a flight, and find out the account balance.

Chatbots are not a customary interface in the digital world. It is possible to talk about a new world in terms of interface with chatbots. Websites and mobile applications use graphical interfaces (GUI), while chatbots use dialog-based interfaces (CUI).

 Chatbots can take place on messaging platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, voice assistants such as Google Assistant and Siri, as well as on the website or mobile application of the relevant institution.
 
 The transformation of curiosity about artificial intelligence into scientific research goes back to the 1950s. In 1951, Alan Turing's "Can machines think? His work (Can machines think?) is seen as the first reference on this subject. The first chatbot is "ELIZA", which was developed by Joseph Weizenbaum, an MIT professor, in 1966. ELIZA was conceived as a psychologist and is intended to create human dialogues. However, since natural language processing and machine learning technologies were not developed enough, at that time, it could only respond with word matching method.

 My goal was to build a chatbot using the pytorch library in Python.
